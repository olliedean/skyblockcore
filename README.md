## Why use Skyblock Core?
This plugin was crafted with the mindset of code what has to be made, and only that. Compared to other plugins, Skyblock Core aims to have no bloat, meaning no throttle to your performance, and an easy to read code base. We aim to provide any and all functionality that a minecraft server owner would look for in plugins for Skyblock.
